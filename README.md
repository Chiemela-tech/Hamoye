# My journey as a Hamoye data science intern was an amazing one
I participated in several projects, both personal and group projects.

For the individual projects, I utilized Kaggle datasets to build machine learning models.

For the group projects, we anlayzed global terrorism trends and gleaned insightful conclusions from the data on terrorist attack patterns. We also built predictive models that will determine the probability of success or failure of terrorist attacks within the period (1970 to 2017).
